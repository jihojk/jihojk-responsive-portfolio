# jihojk-responsive-portfolio

This in an updated responsive portfolio created using Bootstrap components for the second Assignment at UC Irvine's Coding Bootcamp. 

The key points of the assignment was to add a functional navbar, make sure the pages were responsive, and make sure the images were also reponsive. Another major part of the assignment was to utilize Bootstrap.

I started by utilizing the same files from my previous homework, but getting rid of much of the excess css and html that coule easily be replaced by Bootstrap. I used the cards for bootstrap thanks to a helpful hint from Baskhar on slack.
